# SudokuSolver.github.io

A sudoku solver is developed using the knowledge of data structures and algorithms. For each entry, there can't be the same number in the 3x3 box or same row or same column. So whenever some valid numbers are entered, further possible numbers are entered by the computer by the use of backtracking algorithm.
The project is completed using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
